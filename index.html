          Hi Samanta! <br />
          Merry Chirstmas !!!!<br /><br>
          It's been a while since we've known each other. <br>
          I think you always have the ability to make others feel good when you talk!  <br>
          That's why we can keep in touch even though we're so far away from each other. <br>
          I can't wait to meet you in person in the next year.  <br><br>

          I wished my parcel would arrive there on time. <br>
          But it became a New Year's gift instead of a Christmas present lol <br>
          And you know it's really hard to choose what stuff should I buy for gift. <br>
          I picked a gift after thinking as hard as much as possible <br>
          Hence, Don't be mad if you don't like my gifts lol <br>
          Good-bye, then.
