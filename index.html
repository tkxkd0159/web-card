          Hi cheyenne! <br />
          Merry Chirstmas !!!!<br /><br>
          It's been a while since we've known each other. <br>
          I think you always have the ability to make others feel good when you talk!  <br>
          That's why we can keep in touch even though we're so far away from each other. <br>
          I really want to meet you in person after the Corona is over.  <br><br>
          I was really worried when I heard you had the coronavirus. <br>
          Because I felt you were having a hard time in your sentence. <br>
          I hope you get well as soon as possible. <br>
          Good-bye, then.
